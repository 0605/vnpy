"""
vn.py - By Traders, For Traders.

The vn.py project is an open-source quantitative trading framework
that is developed by traders, for traders.

The project is mainly written in Python and uses C++ for low-layer
and performance sensitive infrastructure.

Using the vn.py project, institutional investors and professional
traders, such as hedge funds, prop trading firms and investment banks,
can easily develop complex trading strategies with the Event Engine
Strategy Module, and automatically route their orders to the most
desired destinations, including equity, commodity, forex and many
other financial markets.
